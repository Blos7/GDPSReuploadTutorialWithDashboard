# GDPS Song Reupload Tutorial With @MegaSa1nt's Dashboard
This is a tutorial on how to reupload songs to a GDPS using @MegaSa1nt's dashboard. Using a PC/Laptop for this is recommended.
# Step 1. Download the song
Find the song you're trying to reupload to the GDPS on YouTube and copy the video link. Paste it into [cobalt](https://co.wukko.me/) and then press "paste and download" (make sure audio mode is selected).

# Step 2. Navigate to the GDPS's dashboard

Navigate to the GDPS's dashboard you would like to reupload the song to (Example GDPS Used: MCGDPS) and press the "Reupload" button on the top of the page (This button only appears if you are logged in so login in first).

# Having trouble with 7 digit songs on mobile?

On a few phones, it's hard to type 7 digit songs in the "Enter Song ID" textbox in the editor, but, there are a few workarounds for this.

1. Get a friend with the ability to type 7 digits to upload an empty level using the song, then downloading it and select it in the "Saved Songs" section of the editor.
2. Download [GBoard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en&gl=US) on the google play store. You must activate floating keyboard mode in order for this to work.
3. Go to the comments section of a level and type !song [SONG_ID], submit the comment, and then refresh the level. This may not work on all GDPS's as it is dependant on the permissions given to users by the database owner.

(This will have to be set to 1 for this method to work ^^)
